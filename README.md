## Usage

Instantiate the Routific client :

```
$clientRoutific = $this->get('foodcheri_sdk_routific.client');
```

To resolve Vehicle Routing Problem, instantiate a VehicleRoutingProblem Enpoint object :

```
$problem = new VehicleRoutingProblem();
```

Add a visit to a problem endpoint :

```
$problem->addVisit("order_1", array(
	"location" => array(
        "name" => "Visit1 name",
        "lat" => 49.227607,
        "lng" => -123.1363085
    ),
    "start" => "19:00",
    "end" => "19:30",
    "duration" => 5,
    "load" => 1,
    "type" => "A",
    "priority" => "high"
	)
);
```

Add a vehicle to a problem endpoint :

```
$problem->addVehicle("vehicle_1", array(
	"start_location" => array(
		"id" => "hub id"
        "name" => "hub name",
        "lat" => 49.227607,
        "lng" => -123.1363085
    ),
    "end_location" => array(
		"id" => "hub id",
        "name" => "hub name",
        "lat" => 49.227607,
        "lng" => -123.1363085
    ),
    "shift_start" => "18:00",
    "shift_end" => "22:30",
    "min_visits" => 10,
    "capacity" => 20,
    "type" => ["A", "B"],
    "speed" => "bike",
    "strict_start" => true,
    "break_start" => "12:00",
    "break_end" => "13:30",
    "break_duration" => 30
	)
);
```

Add an option to a problem endpoint :

```
"options": {
   "traffic": "slow",
   "min_visits_per_vehicle": 5,
   "balance": true,
   "min_vehicles": true,
   "shortest_distance": true
}
```
```
$problem->addOption(array("traffic" => "slow"));
```

Finaly execute the route calculation for the endpoint problem :

```
$clientRoutific->route($problem);
```
